Script       : <div>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;">Forge Group Limited&rsquo;s (ASX:FGE) chief has shrugged off speculation the engineering company is a takeover target following its significant share price spike over the past week. &nbsp;</span><br />
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	CEO David Simpson reportedly denied the rumours when asked by media and instead pointed to the company&rsquo;s latest contract awards as reason for the gains.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<br />
	Forge yesterday responded to its second price query from the Australian Securities Exchange in under a week.</div>

	<br />
	After surging more than 40 per cent last week the company could only attribute the prior week&rsquo;s $40 million worth of contract awards for the rise. &nbsp;</div>
<div>

	The gains come after Forge dramatically plunged 90 per cent on the back of a profit warning issued in November.</div>

	Most global markets are also on track to book a bumper year of gains including the local benchmark which has advanced about 15 per cent over 2013. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

	The Australian share market looks set to pause from the year&rsquo;s really and slip in the last day of the year. While Wall Street mainly finished weaker overnight the three major indexes have jumped more than 25 per cent this year.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Most global markets are also on track to book a bumper year of gains including the local benchmark which has advanced about 15 per cent over 2013. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Today&rsquo;s trading volumes are expected to be subdued over a shortened session - ahead of New Years celebrations tonight and tomorrow&#39;s public holiday before trade resumes again on Thursday.&nbsp;</div>
