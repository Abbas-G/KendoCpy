HTTP 304 is "not modified". Your web server is basically telling the browser "this file hasn't changed since the last time you requested it." 
Whereas an HTTP 200 is telling the browser "here is a successful response" - which should be returned when it's either the first time your browser is accessing the file or the first time a modified copy is being accessed.
